	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p> The two sites that inspire me are <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1835645-Leon-s-Poultry-Oysters-pt-II?list=shots&sort=popular&timeframe=now&offset=3"> Leon&#39;s Poultry & Oysters</a> and <a href="http://www.siteinspire.com/websites/5140-paul-macgregor"> Paul Macgregor&#39;s site</a>.</p>



	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>Much like the website shown in video three for Frank Chimero,  Leon&#39;s Poultry & Oysters is attempting to use a strong focal point to draw the users eyes to the left side of the screen and the restaurant title. The size of the font is also key in drawing the attention to the title, rather than the chicken graphic on the other side. Although I find the use of the main focal point to be relatively effective, I do think the chicken graphic is somewhat distracting and may need to be resized. &quotWhen everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized&quot.</p>

	<p>Opposite of the design concepts utilized in the first site I chose Paul Macgregor&#39;s site does not have singular focal point. There are multiple items the eye is drawn to and the logo/title is de-emphasized to encourage interaction and site exploration from the user. </p>


	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Besides the differences described above, the two site also differ in that Paul Macgregor&#39;s site has much more negative space, and uses images that are unevenly distributed. However, Leon&#39;s Poultry & Oysters uses very balanced elements. While I feel that Leon&#39;s site is more to the point, I find myself more interested in exploring Paul&#39;s and staying on the page for an extended period of time. Neither is bad, and I believe both achieve the desired goal for the end user. </p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<p> Below are the thumbnail sketches I created to begin laying out the site I want to build. My site will be for my company, Stability Biologics. Our main issue is that our current site is out of date, and doesn't provde the most fluid user experience. I would like to create something that encourages customers and sales reps to utilize the site in presentations, research and general product inquiry.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Stability Home Page 1</strong><p>This set up sets up a main focal point of important information, news and updates. It encourages further exploration by setting up sub sections at the bottom that will link to other pages, and provide the user alternate access to the other pages, other than just through the menu.</p><img src="Stability Main page 1.gif" alt="Stability Main Page 1" height="175" width="275"></li>
		<li><strong>Stability Home Page 2</strong><p>This layout uses two focal points, one for news/updates and one for the main content. The logo is de-emphasized to draw the users eye to the content of the page.</p><img src="Stability Main page 2.gif" alt="Stability Main Page 2" height="175" width="275"></li>
		<li><strong>Stability Product Page 1</strong><p>This product page, uses two focal points. One is the menu for the available products, and another for the main product content. The hierarchy for this page is the products, which is the most important purpose of our company page.</p><img src="Stability Product page 1.gif" alt="Stability Product Page 1" height="175" width="275"></li>	</li>
		<li><strong>Stability Product Page 2</strong><p>This page uses the same gridllines from its parent page, as well as two focal points.</p><img src="Stability Product page 2.gif" alt="Stability Product Page 2" height="175" width="275"></li>		</ul>
